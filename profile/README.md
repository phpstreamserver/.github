[**PHPStreamServer**](https://phpstreamserver.dev/) is a high-performance, event-loop-based application server and supervisor for PHP, written in PHP.  
Built on top of the [AMPHP](https://amphp.org/) ecosystem and powered by the [Revolt](https://revolt.run/) event loop,
PHPStreamServer delivers asynchronous capabilities that empower the development of efficient and scalable PHP applications.
PHPStreamServer ships with a collection of plugins, making it highly extensible.
With the power of plugins, PHPStreamServer can replace traditional setups such as nginx, php-fpm, cron, and supervisor.
By centralizing these functionalities into a single application server, it reduces complexity and simplifies application deployment.
Being written in PHP, it only requires PHP to runâ€”no additional dependencies are needed.
Applications run in an always-loaded, in-memory model, which significantly improves performance by eliminating the overhead of repeated
loading and initialization.
